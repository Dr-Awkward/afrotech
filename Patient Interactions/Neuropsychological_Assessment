## BACKGROUND INFORMATION

### Developmental and Medical History:

[Patient Name] was born at 41 weeks gestation to a 24-year-old mother who received early prenatal care starting around 6 weeks of pregnancy. The pregnancy was reportedly uncomplicated, though labor was induced due to the mother's severe back and sciatic pain. [Patient Name] was born vaginally at a local hospital, weighing 7 pounds and measuring 18 3/4 inches. The birth process was described as normal, with no significant complications. [Patient Name] and her mother were discharged after two days. Early feeding involved breastfeeding for approximately one month, which was discontinued due to the mother experiencing severe mastitis requiring IV antibiotics. [Patient Name] transitioned to formula without issue. Her early developmental milestones were reported as age-appropriate, with crawling at 7 months, walking at 1 year, first words around 10 months, and 2-3 word sentences by 1 year. Toilet training was achieved at 18 months for daytime and 3 years for nighttime. [Patient Name]'s parents described her as adaptable and "going with the flow," with minimal tantrums and no significant sensory sensitivities or unusual play behaviors. Medical history is notable for approximately four ER visits due to high fevers associated with ear infections, which were generally responsive to antibiotics. [Patient Name] has a known allergy to penicillin. Sleep patterns were reported as excellent in early childhood, with some current difficulties in falling or staying asleep, though she maintains a consistent sleep schedule across both households.

### Educational History:

[Patient Name]'s educational journey began with early exposure to diverse learning experiences under the care of her paternal grandmother from 3 months to 2 years of age. She then attended a local nursery from ages 2 to 5, where she was described as shy but generally had a positive experience, interacting well with peers and teachers after an initial warming-up period. From ages 5 to 8 (Year 1 to Year 3), [Patient Name] attended a primary school, where she was noted as a "great student" but "really quiet." A significant transition occurred when [Patient Name] moved to a different school in Year 4 due to potential closure of her previous school. This transition revealed some academic gaps, particularly in mathematics and languages, requiring extra support within the classroom and additional assistance from her paternal grandfather, a former teacher. [Patient Name] reportedly caught up academically within that same school year. Throughout middle school, [Patient Name] maintained a small, comfortable group of friends but often remained on the social periphery. Currently in her junior year (equivalent to US 11th grade), [Patient Name] is described as a hardworking and organized student who excels in classwork but struggles with test performance. This was notably evident in her recent standardized examinations, where she initially did not pass six subjects. With medication and adjusted testing conditions, [Patient Name] successfully improved her English grade from a D to a B upon retaking the exam. The school's response to [Patient Name]'s learning needs and test anxiety has been a source of concern for her parents, who seek clearer communication and support strategies.

### Family and Cultural History:

[Patient Name] comes from a blended family structure following her parents' divorce when she was 2 years old. Her mother, [Mother's Name], age 44, holds a master's degree with additional professional designations and works as the Head of Human Resources at a company. [Patient Name]'s father, [Father's Name], age 41, has a high school diploma and works as a fisherman and stay-at-home dad. Both parents have remarried, creating a complex family dynamic. [Patient Name] splits her time equally between two households, spending alternating weeks with each parent. In her mother's household, [Patient Name] lives with her stepfather (age 40), younger half-sister (age 7), and occasionally her older stepsister (age 20) when home from university. In her father's household, she resides with her stepmother (age 44) and half-brother (age 11). Both biological parents reported experiencing difficulties with mathematics in their early education, which may be relevant to [Patient Name]'s current academic challenges. The family identifies with their local culture, and while specific cultural practices were not detailed, the local context likely influences [Patient Name]'s educational and social experiences. The family history of academic struggles, particularly in mathematics, combined with the complexities of a blended family structure and frequent transitions between households, may contribute to [Patient Name]'s current academic and emotional challenges.

### Social-Emotional and Behavioral History:

[Patient Name] has been described as shy since early childhood, a trait that has persisted and evolved into more pronounced anxiety, particularly in academic performance situations. Her anxiety has significantly impacted her test performance, as evidenced by her initial standardized test results. To address this, [Patient Name] has been prescribed propranolol 10mg, which she takes as needed before tests, with reported improvement in her performance. Despite her shyness and anxiety, [Patient Name] has been able to form and maintain friendships, although many of her closer friends have left for boarding schools. She maintains communication with these friends and socializes with them when they return. [Patient Name] is described as a perfectionist who fears making mistakes, which likely contributes to her test anxiety. Significant life events that may have impacted [Patient Name]'s social-emotional development include her parents' divorce at age 2, multiple house moves between ages 2 and 13, and the ongoing transitions between two households every week from age 2 to the present. Despite these challenges, [Patient Name] is reported to enjoy artistic activities, listening to music, and spending time with family. She is described as willing to try various activities, though she is not particularly athletic. The combination of her perfectionist tendencies, anxiety, and the emotional impacts of family transitions appear to be significant factors in [Patient Name]'s current social-emotional presentation.

### Behavioral Observations:

During the evaluation, [Patient Name] presented as a polite and cooperative 16-year-old girl. She appeared somewhat anxious initially but gradually became more comfortable as the assessment progressed. [Patient Name] demonstrated good attention and effort throughout the testing sessions, working diligently on all tasks presented to her. Her communication style was generally reserved, consistent with reports of her shyness, but she was able to articulate her thoughts and respond to questions when prompted. [Patient Name]'s anxiety became more noticeable during timed tasks and those involving mathematical computations, manifesting as increased fidgeting and occasional requests for clarification. Despite these moments of visible discomfort, she persevered through all tasks without giving up. [Patient Name]'s perfectionist tendencies were evident in her careful approach to tasks and her occasional expressions of frustration when uncertain about her performance. Overall, [Patient Name]'s behavior during the evaluation was consistent with the reported concerns about anxiety and perfectionism, while also demonstrating her resilience and determination to perform to the best of her abilities.

### Intellectual Development:

[Patient Name]'s intellectual functioning was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV), which provides a comprehensive evaluation of cognitive abilities across various domains. The WAIS-IV yields a Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) score, which represents overall intellectual functioning, as well as index scores for specific cognitive domains including Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed.

[Patient Name]'s Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) score of 97 (42nd percentile) falls within the Average range, indicating that her overall intellectual functioning is consistent with that of her same-age peers. This score suggests that [Patient Name] has the cognitive capacity to engage with age-appropriate academic material and problem-solving tasks. However, it's important to note that there is significant variability among her index scores, which provides a more nuanced understanding of her cognitive profile.

[Patient Name]'s strongest performance was observed in the Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), with a score of 115 (84th percentile), falling in the High Average range. This index measures nonverbal and fluid reasoning, spatial processing, and visual-motor integration. [Patient Name]'s performance on this index suggests a particular strength in understanding and manipulating visual information, which could be beneficial in areas such as science, geometry, and visual arts. Within this index, [Patient Name] performed exceptionally well on the Block Design subtest (95th percentile), indicating strong visual-spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills.

In contrast, [Patient Name]'s performance on the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) was lower, with a score of 96 (39th percentile), falling in the Average range. This index assesses verbal concept formation, verbal reasoning, and knowledge acquired from one's environment. While still within normal limits, this relative weakness compared to her nonverbal abilities might impact her performance in language-heavy subjects and her ability to express complex ideas verbally.

[Patient Name]'s scores on the Working Memory Index (WMI) and Processing Speed Index (PSI) were both 86 (18th percentile), falling in the Low Average range. These lower scores are particularly noteworthy as they form the Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI), which at 83 (13th percentile) is significantly discrepant from her General Ability Index (GAI) of 105 (63rd percentile). This discrepancy is clinically significant, occurring in only 5.7% of the population, and suggests that [Patient Name]'s ability to process information quickly and manipulate information in short-term memory is not commensurate with her overall cognitive potential.

The significant strengths in [Patient Name]'s perceptual reasoning abilities, coupled with average verbal comprehension, suggest that she has the cognitive capacity to understand complex concepts and solve problems, particularly when presented visually. However, her lower scores in working memory and processing speed may impact her ability to efficiently manipulate information and complete tasks quickly, which could contribute to her difficulties in test-taking situations and subjects requiring rapid information processing, such as mathematics.

In real-world applications, [Patient Name]'s cognitive profile suggests that she may excel in tasks that allow her to utilize her strong visual-spatial skills and take time to process information thoroughly. However, she may struggle in fast-paced environments or when required to quickly manipulate information mentally. This profile could explain her reported success with classwork, where she has time to organize and process information, contrasted with her difficulties in test situations, which often demand quick recall and processing.

Understanding this cognitive profile is crucial for developing appropriate support strategies for [Patient Name]. Leveraging her strengths in visual-spatial reasoning while providing accommodations that address her processing speed and working memory challenges could significantly improve her academic performance and reduce anxiety in testing situations. Strategies such as providing extended time on tests, breaking complex tasks into smaller steps, and utilizing visual aids in instruction could be particularly beneficial for [Patient Name].

### Academic Achievement:

[Patient Name]'s academic achievement was assessed using the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WIAT-4), which provides a comprehensive evaluation of academic skills across various domains including reading, mathematics, and writing. This assessment offers valuable insights into [Patient Name]'s academic strengths and weaknesses, helping to identify any specific learning disorders and informing targeted intervention strategies.

In the domain of reading, [Patient Name]'s performance was generally within the Average range, with some variability across different aspects of reading skills. Her Basic Reading Index, which combines word reading and pseudoword decoding, was at the 27th percentile (Standard Score 91), indicating Average performance. This suggests that [Patient Name] has developed adequate foundational reading skills, including phonological awareness and decoding abilities. Her performance on the Orthographic Choice subtest (50th percentile, Standard Score 100) further supports her average development of word recognition skills.

However, [Patient Name]'s performance on reading fluency tasks revealed some challenges. Her Reading Fluency Index, which includes measures of oral reading fluency and orthographic fluency, was at the 12th percentile (Standard Score 82), falling in the Low Average range. This discrepancy between her basic reading skills and reading fluency suggests that while [Patient Name] can accurately decode words, she may struggle with the speed and automaticity of reading. Such difficulties can impact reading comprehension, especially under timed conditions, and may contribute to her reported test anxiety.

[Patient Name]'s reading comprehension skills (32nd percentile, Standard Score 93) were found to be in the Average range, indicating that she can understand and interpret written material at a level consistent with her peers when given sufficient time. This strength in comprehension, despite fluency challenges, suggests that [Patient Name] may benefit from extended time accommodations for reading-intensive tasks.

In the area of mathematics, [Patient Name]'s performance revealed significant challenges, supporting the provisional diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder with Impairment in Mathematics (Dyscalculia). Her Mathematics Index, which combines math problem solving and numerical operations, was at the 9th percentile (Standard Score 80), falling in the Low Average range. This score is notably discrepant from her overall cognitive abilities, particularly her strong perceptual reasoning skills.

Breaking down the mathematics performance, [Patient Name] struggled across various aspects of mathematical skills. Her Math Problem Solving score (13th percentile, Standard Score 83) and Numerical Operations score (9th percentile, Standard Score 80) were both in the Low Average range. Additionally, her Math Fluency Index was at the 9th percentile (Standard Score 80), indicating difficulties with rapid retrieval and application of basic math facts. These results are consistent with the reported struggles in mathematics throughout [Patient Name]'s educational history and align with the family history of math difficulties reported by both parents.

In the domain of writing, [Patient Name] demonstrated relative strength. Her performance on the Spelling subtest was in the Average range (55th percentile, Standard Score 102), indicating well-developed orthographic skills. Her Sentence Composition skills were particularly strong, falling in the High Average range (75th percentile, Standard Score 110), with notable strength in Sentence Combining (92nd percentile, Standard Score 121). These results suggest that [Patient Name] has well-developed written expression skills, which could be leveraged as a compensatory strategy in her academic work.

The pattern of [Patient Name]'s academic achievement results provides clear evidence for a Specific Learning Disorder with Impairment in Mathematics. Her mathematics scores are significantly below what would be expected based on her cognitive abilities and are pervasive across different aspects of mathematical skills. The discrepancy between her math performance and her abilities in other academic areas, particularly writing, further supports this diagnosis.

Additionally, the assessment reveals academic fluency weaknesses, particularly in reading and math, which may contribute to [Patient Name]'s difficulties in test-taking situations. These fluency challenges, combined with her average to above-average performance in untimed conditions, suggest that extended time accommodations could significantly benefit [Patient Name]'s academic performance.

In summary, [Patient Name]'s academic profile is characterized by average to above-average skills in reading comprehension and written expression, with significant weaknesses in mathematics and academic fluency. This pattern of strengths and weaknesses aligns with her reported academic experiences and provides a foundation for targeted interventions and accommodations to support her learning and manage her test anxiety.

### Other Relevant Neuropsychological Scores:

In addition to the core cognitive and academic measures, several other neuropsychological assessments were conducted to provide a comprehensive understanding of [Patient Name]'s functioning across various domains. These additional measures offer valuable insights into her attention, executive functioning, and social-emotional well-being, which are crucial for interpreting her overall neuropsychological profile and informing appropriate interventions.

Attention and inhibitory control were assessed using the Nesplora Aquarium, a virtual reality-based continuous performance test. [Patient Name]'s performance on this measure revealed a complex pattern of attentional strengths and weaknesses. Her overall attention score, based on total omissions, was in the Low Average range (16th percentile, T-score 40), suggesting some difficulties with sustained attention. However, her inhibitory control, measured by total commissions, was in the Average range (27th percentile, T-score 44), indicating adequate ability to inhibit inappropriate responses. Interestingly, [Patient Name]'s processing speed on this task was in the High Average range (84th percentile, T-score 60), which contrasts with her lower processing speed scores on the WAIS-IV. This discrepancy may suggest that [Patient Name]'s processing speed improves in more engaging, visually stimulating environments.

Executive functioning was further evaluated using the D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test and Tower Test. On the Color-Word Interference Test, which assesses cognitive flexibility and inhibition, [Patient Name]'s performance was variable. Her basic naming and reading speeds were in the Low Average to Average range (Scaled Scores 6 and 8, respectively), consistent with her processing speed weaknesses. However, her performance on the inhibition task was Below Average (5th percentile, Scaled Score 5), suggesting difficulties with cognitive control under time pressure. Interestingly, her performance improved on the more complex inhibition/switching task (16th percentile, Scaled Score 7), possibly indicating that she performs better when fully engaged in challenging tasks.

On the D-KEFS Tower Test, which assesses planning and problem-solving skills, [Patient Name] performed in the High Average range (84th percentile, Scaled Score 13) for total achievement. This score aligns with her strong perceptual reasoning abilities and suggests that she has well-developed spatial planning and problem-solving skills when not under time pressure.

Language skills were assessed using subtests from the WIAT-4. [Patient Name]'s expressive vocabulary was in the Low Average range (9th percentile, Standard Score 80), which is somewhat lower than expected given her Average Verbal Comprehension Index. However, her performance on oral word fluency was in the High Average range (75th percentile, Standard Score 110), and her sentence repetition skills were Average (47th percentile, Standard Score 99). This pattern suggests that while [Patient Name] may struggle with rapid retrieval of specific vocabulary, she has strong verbal fluency and adequate syntactic skills.

Fine motor skills and processing speed were evaluated using the Grooved Pegboard test. [Patient Name]'s performance with her dominant right hand was in the Average range (19th percentile, z-score -0.86), but her performance with her non-dominant left hand was in the Below Average range (1st percentile, z-score -2.26). This significant discrepancy between hands may indicate some lateralized motor or processing speed weaknesses that could impact activities requiring bimanual coordination or rapid fine motor skills.

Verbal learning and memory were assessed using subtests from the Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition (WMS-IV). [Patient Name]'s immediate recall for verbal information (Logical Memory I) was Average (50th percentile, Scaled Score 10), but her delayed recall (Logical Memory II) was Low Average (16th percentile, Scaled Score 7). This pattern suggests that while [Patient Name] can adequately encode verbal information, she may have some difficulties with long-term retention or retrieval. Her performance on Verbal Paired Associates was stronger, with both immediate and delayed recall in the High Average range (75th percentile, Scaled Score 12), indicating good associative verbal learning and memory.

Nonverbal learning and memory, as measured by the Visual Reproduction subtests of the WMS-IV, showed a strength in [Patient Name]'s profile. Her immediate and delayed recall for visual information were both in the Average to High Average range (50th and 84th percentiles, Scaled Scores 10 and 13, respectively). This performance aligns with her strong perceptual reasoning abilities and suggests that [Patient Name] may learn and retain information more effectively when presented visually.

Social-emotional functioning was assessed through parent and teacher reports using the Conners Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scales (CBRS). Both parents and teachers reported significant concerns with social problems and emotional distress, particularly anxiety. The CBRS Social Problems scale was in the Very Elevated range across all raters, indicating pervasive social difficulties. Emotional Distress scales were also in the Very Elevated range, particularly for worrying and social anxiety. These results are consistent with the reported concerns about [Patient Name]'s shyness and anxiety, especially in social and performance situations.

The Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory, Second Edition (MACI-II) provided further insight into [Patient Name]'s personality and clinical presentation. Elevated scores on the Introversive, Inhibited, and Submissive scales align with her reported shyness and social anxiety. Significantly elevated scores on the Identity Diffusion, Self-Devaluation, and Peer Insecurity scales suggest underlying issues with self-esteem and social confidence. The clinical syndrome scales revealed significantly elevated scores for Anxious Feelings and Depressive Affect, corroborating the diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder with emerging depressive features.

In summary, these additional neuropsychological measures provide a nuanced understanding of [Patient Name]'s cognitive and emotional functioning. They highlight strengths in visual-spatial processing, problem-solving, and nonverbal memory, which can be leveraged in academic interventions. The results also confirm significant challenges with anxiety, social interaction, and aspects of executive functioning, particularly in high-pressure situations. This comprehensive profile will be instrumental in developing tailored strategies to support [Patient Name]'s academic success and emotional well-being.

Academic fluency weaknesses

### Discussion of Assessment Impressions:

A careful examination of [Patient Name]'s developmental, educational, and social-emotional history helps to better understand her current presentation. [Patient Name]'s profile is characterized by a complex interplay of cognitive strengths, specific learning challenges, and significant anxiety that collectively impact her academic performance and emotional well-being.

The assessment supports a primary diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) with panic attacks, which appears to be severely impacting [Patient Name]'s daily functioning, particularly in academic settings. This diagnosis is consistent with [Patient Name]'s long-standing history of shyness that has evolved into more pronounced anxiety, especially evident in performance situations such as tests and exams. The severity of her anxiety is underscored by its impact on her standardized test performance and the need for medication to manage symptoms during testing situations. The emergence of depressive features, as indicated by the MACI-II results, suggests that [Patient Name]'s chronic anxiety may be contributing to a lowered mood and self-esteem issues.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about various aspects of life, accompanied by physical symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances. In [Patient Name]'s case, her anxiety appears to be particularly focused on academic performance and social situations. The presence of panic attacks suggests that her anxiety can escalate to intense episodes of fear and physical discomfort, which likely exacerbate her test anxiety and social challenges.

Research indicates that GAD affects approximately 2.5-6.4% of adolescents, with a higher prevalence in females. The disorder often has its onset in childhood or adolescence and, if left untreated, can persist into adulthood and lead to significant impairments in social, academic, and occupational functioning. The emergence of depressive symptoms is not uncommon in individuals with chronic anxiety, as the persistent worry and associated limitations can lead to feelings of hopelessness and low self-worth.

Concurrent with her anxiety disorder, [Patient Name] presents with a profile consistent with a Specific Learning Disorder with Impairment in Mathematics, provisionally diagnosed as Dyscalculia. This diagnosis is supported by [Patient Name]'s significantly below-average performance on mathematical tasks across various domains, including calculation, problem-solving, and math fluency. The persistent nature of these difficulties, their specificity to mathematics, and the discrepancy between her math performance and her overall cognitive abilities meet the diagnostic criteria for this learning disorder.

Dyscalculia is estimated to affect 3-7% of the population and is characterized by persistent difficulties in learning and using mathematics. Neurologically, dyscalculia is associated with atypical functioning in brain regions crucial for numerical processing, particularly the intraparietal sulcus and the prefrontal cortex. Recent research suggests that individuals with dyscalculia may have difficulties with the mental representation of quantities, accessing numerical magnitude information from symbols, and executing arithmetic procedures efficiently.

It's important to note the potential interaction between [Patient Name]'s anxiety and her mathematical difficulties. While the learning disorder in mathematics appears to be a distinct entity, her anxiety likely exacerbates her performance in math-related tasks, creating a cycle of poor performance and increased anxiety. This interaction underscores the importance of addressing both the anxiety and the learning disorder in [Patient Name]'s treatment plan.

[Patient Name]'s cognitive profile, characterized by strengths in perceptual reasoning and relative weaknesses in processing speed and working memory, provides further context for understanding her academic challenges. Her strong visual-spatial skills and nonverbal problem-solving abilities suggest potential for success in many academic areas when information is presented visually or through hands-on experiences. However, her difficulties with processing speed and working memory may contribute to challenges in timed situations and tasks requiring rapid manipulation of information, which are often central to standardized testing and mathematics.

The assessment also revealed academic fluency weaknesses, particularly in reading and math. These fluency challenges, combined with her anxiety, likely contribute significantly to her difficulties in test-taking situations. In real-world terms, this means that while [Patient Name] may have the knowledge and understanding of academic material, she struggles to demonstrate this knowledge efficiently under time pressure or in high-stakes situations.

From a neuropsychological perspective, [Patient Name]'s profile suggests inefficiencies in the frontal-subcortical circuits involved in processing speed, working memory, and emotional regulation. The prefrontal cortex, crucial for executive functions and emotional control, may be particularly affected by her anxiety, leading to difficulties in attention regulation and cognitive flexibility in stressful situations. The involvement of the limbic system, particularly the amygdala, in her anxiety responses likely contributes to the heightened emotional reactivity she experiences in academic and social settings.

It's crucial to recognize that despite these challenges, [Patient Name] demonstrates significant cognitive and academic strengths, particularly in visual-spatial reasoning, reading comprehension, and written expression. These strengths provide a foundation for developing compensatory strategies and building self-efficacy. Moreover, [Patient Name]'s improved performance when given appropriate support (such as medication for anxiety and adjusted testing conditions) suggests that with the right interventions and accommodations, she has the potential for significant academic success.

In considering [Patient Name]'s future trajectory, it's important to address both her immediate academic needs and her long-term emotional well-being. Untreated anxiety and learning disorders in adolescence can have far-reaching consequences, potentially impacting educational attainment, career choices, and overall quality of life. However, with appropriate interventions, individuals with GAD and specific learning disorders can develop effective coping strategies, improve their academic performance, and lead fulfilling lives.

The complexity of [Patient Name]'s presentation underscores the importance of a multifaceted treatment approach that addresses her anxiety, supports her learning needs, and builds on her cognitive and academic strengths. By providing [Patient Name] with the tools to manage her anxiety, strategies to compensate for her learning difficulties, and opportunities to leverage her strengths, we can help her develop resilience and achieve her full potential.
