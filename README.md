# AI-Powered Document Processing Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project presents an innovative, AI-powered document processing pipeline designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of healthcare professionals, particularly in the field of neuropsychology and behavioral health. By leveraging cutting-edge cloud technologies and artificial intelligence, our solution aims to significantly reduce the time spent on administrative tasks, allowing professionals to focus more on patient care.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals, especially those in neuropsychology and behavioral health, often spend a disproportionate amount of time on paperwork and report writing. This administrative burden can lead to:

- Longer wait times for patients, particularly in underprivileged communities
- Increased stress and burnout among healthcare providers
- Reduced time for direct patient care and professional development

Our solution addresses these challenges by automating and optimizing the document processing workflow, potentially saving up to 40% of report writing time.

## Technical Architecture

Our pipeline utilizes Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and OpenAI's GPT models to create a robust, scalable, and secure document processing system. Here's an overview of the technical process:

1. **File Upload and Storage**: 
   - Files are uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
   - The system supports various file formats, including ZIP archives.

2. **Unzipping and Initial Processing**:
   - ZIP files are automatically extracted.
   - The contents are organized into appropriate folders within the bucket.

3. **PDF to Image Conversion**:
   - PDF documents are converted to high-quality JPEG images.
   - Images are stored in subfolders for efficient processing.

4. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**:
   - Google Cloud Vision API is used to perform OCR on the images.
   - Extracted text is saved as individual text files.

5. **Text Concatenation**:
   - Text files from related documents are concatenated into a single file.
   - This step prepares the data for AI processing.

6. **AI-Powered Analysis**:
   - The concatenated text is processed using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.
   - A custom system prompt guides the AI to generate relevant content.

7. **HTML Report Generation**:
   - The AI's output is formatted into a clean, professional HTML report.

8. **Email Notification**:
   - The generated report is automatically emailed to the healthcare professional.

## Key Technologies

- **Google Cloud Platform**: Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Secret Manager
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-3.5 model for advanced text processing
- **Python**: Core programming language for all processing scripts
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For image processing tasks
- **Pandoc**: For document format conversions

## Security and Compliance

- All sensitive information is managed using Google Cloud Secret Manager.
- Data transmission is encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
- The system is designed with HIPAA compliance in mind, ensuring patient data privacy.

## Impact on Communities of Color

This solution has the potential to significantly impact healthcare accessibility in communities of color:

1. **Reduced Wait Times**: By streamlining administrative tasks, healthcare providers can see more patients, potentially reducing long wait times often experienced in underserved communities.

2. **Improved Quality of Care**: With less time spent on paperwork, professionals can dedicate more time to direct patient care and staying updated with the latest treatment methods.

3. **Increased Accessibility**: The time saved could allow for more pro-bono work or reduced-cost services, making quality healthcare more accessible to underprivileged communities.

4. **Enhanced Early Intervention**: Faster processing of evaluations and reports can lead to quicker diagnoses and treatment plans, crucial for conditions that benefit from early intervention.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
- Support for multiple languages to serve diverse communities
- Implementation of a user-friendly front-end for healthcare providers to manage and customize their workflows

## Conclusion

This AI-powered document processing pipeline represents a significant step forward in reducing the administrative burden on healthcare professionals. By leveraging advanced technologies, we aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery, particularly in underserved communities of color.
