# AI-Powered Document Processing Pipeline

## Overview

This project presents an innovative solution to streamline document processing in healthcare and social services, with a particular focus on reducing paperwork for neuropsychologists, IEP evaluations, and social workers. By leveraging cloud technologies and AI, we aim to give professionals more time for patient care and reduce wait times for underprivileged communities.

## Technical Architecture

Our solution utilizes Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services to create a seamless, serverless pipeline for document processing:

1. **File Upload**: Documents are uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
2. **Unzip and Convert**: 
   - ZIP files are extracted.
   - Non-PDF documents are converted to PDF format.
3. **PDF to Image**: PDFs are converted to high-quality JPEG images.
4. **AI Processing**: 
   - Images are analyzed using Claude AI (Anthropic) for advanced text recognition and understanding.
   - A separate process uses GPT (OpenAI) for additional natural language processing.
5. **Result Compilation**: AI-generated insights are compiled into a single HTML document.
6. **Email Delivery**: The final report is emailed back to the original sender.

## Key Components

### 1. File Ingestion and Preparation
- Utilizes Google Cloud Functions triggered by Cloud Storage events.
- Handles various file formats, ensuring all documents are converted to a standard format (PDF) for processing.

### 2. Image Processing
- Converts PDFs to high-resolution JPEG images for AI analysis.
- Implements smart batching to handle large documents efficiently.

### 3. AI Integration
- Leverages Claude AI (Anthropic) for advanced image and text analysis.
- Incorporates GPT (OpenAI) for natural language understanding and report generation.
- Uses custom prompts stored securely in Google Secret Manager.

### 4. Result Compilation
- Aggregates AI-generated insights into a comprehensive HTML report.
- Ensures formatting consistency and readability.

### 5. Secure Delivery
- Implements Gmail API integration for secure email delivery.
- Attaches the generated report and sends it to the original document submitter.

## Security and Compliance

- All data is processed within GCP's secure environment.
- Credentials and API keys are managed using Google Secret Manager.
- Implements principle of least privilege in IAM roles.

## Scalability and Performance

- Serverless architecture allows for automatic scaling based on demand.
- Efficient use of cloud resources minimizes processing time and costs.

## Impact on Healthcare Equity

This solution directly addresses the challenges faced by healthcare professionals and social workers, particularly those serving underprivileged communities:

1. **Time Savings**: Reduces report writing time by up to 40%, allowing professionals to see more patients or provide more in-depth care.
2. **Reduced Burnout**: Alleviates the administrative burden on healthcare providers, potentially reducing burnout rates.
3. **Improved Access**: By increasing efficiency, this tool can help reduce wait times for behavioral health services in underserved areas.
4. **Consistency**: Ensures a baseline of quality and completeness in reports, which is crucial for continuity of care.

## Future Enhancements

1. Integration with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.
2. Automatic templating to speed up the onboarding process. 
3. Development of a more user-friendly interface for real-time editing and customization of AI-generated reports.
4. Potential to have first mover advantage at one of, if not the largest data lakes available.
